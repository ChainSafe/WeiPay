# WeiPay ERC20 Wallet

WeiPay is a open source cryptocurrency wallet available for both IOS and Android mobile devices. 
WeiPay will support Ethereum out of the box with added support for ERC20 tokens and Bitcoin. 
An api will be created to host token details on IPFS in order for any fork of the wallet to provide 
uniform data to its users with the added benefits of reduced app storage space.

+ ```npm install``` or ```yarn install``` 
+ ```react-native link```
+ React Native/Xcode Third Party Glog issue when building to physical IOS device
+ Solution
  - Double Conversion Errors 
  - Xcode -> Libraries -> RCTWebSocket.xcodeproj -> Build Phases - > Link Binary   with Libraries -> select libfishhook.a and click " - " button. Click " + " and add libfishhook.a to add the broken dependency.
  - ```https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/19839```
  - React Native third party library issue -> ```https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/14382```
  - Solution: ```CD /node_modules/react-native/third-party/glog & ./configure```
  - This will throw one last error in xcode, you must change the return value of the function to NULL and comment out the current return statement (return (void*)context->PC_FROM_UCONTEXT;).
  - ```https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/16106```
  - Build & run project -> select developer profile -> make sure deployment targets are the same in both your project and the tests project -> WeiPay should build to your physical ios device

## Android On Device

 1.  Enable the Developers options on the Android Device
 2. Enable Usb debugging in the Developers option
 3. Run the following command in the project directory : ```adb reverse tcp:8081 tcp:8081```
